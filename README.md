# prop-tip-speed-calculator
Calculate tip speed and track values over time. Optimize settings to achieve maximum efficiency.

- RPM * Prop Max Circumference over Distance / Time = Prop Tip Speed
- Prop Tip Speed + Airspeed = Max Tip Speed?
- Motor kV rating * battery V rating = unloaded RPM estimate
- consider airframe pitch, horizontal velocity, vertical velocity?
